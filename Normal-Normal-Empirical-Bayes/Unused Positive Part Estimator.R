Suppose that you have an estimate of $\sigma^2$. One thing needs to be taken into account - it's actually possible that, depending on your estimation method, $\sigma^2$ gets estimated larger than $Var(x) = \sigma^2 + \tau^2$ - aside from making no internal sense, and m this means that some observations will get shrunk past the population mean, and that's not what we want. The way to fix this is to take the positive-part estimator:


$\hat{\sigma^2} + \hat{\tau^2} = \hat{\sigma^2} + \max(Var(x) - \hat{\sigma^2}, 0)$


This ensures that we never accidentally shrink too much.
